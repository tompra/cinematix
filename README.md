## Description

Using React, build the client-side for an app called popcornHub based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database).

## Objective

By the end of the project, Iâ€™ll have a complete web app (client-side and server-side) built using full-stack JavaScript technologies. This project will demonstrate your mastery of full-stack JavaScript development. The complete tech stack to master the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack.

## How to get the project running

1. Create directory in your local computer `mk dir <name_your_directory>`
2. Clone the GitHub repository using the command: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
4. Install dependencies `npm install`
5. Run the project: `npm run dev`

## Project

## Project Role: Developer

I was reponsible for creating a React web app that interacts with a the movie API that I made previously to display movie information and user data. The project involved building the UI components, handling user authentication, integrated with the API and implementing search and favorite movies.

## Task completed

1. Developed a React web app using functional components and React Router for navigation
2. Created UI components.
3. Integrated user authentication and token managment, allowing users to log in and maintain session state.
4. Fetch movie data from the movie API.
5. Implemented features to search for movies based on user input
6. Add the ability for users to mak movies as favorites.
7. Provided a logout feature to user to log out and clear session.

## What could be done differently?

1. Include adding more information, such as actors and directors views, release date, and ratings.
2. Expanding user profiles with user photos and recommendations for other users.
3. Implementing advanced movie filtering by genre, actors, and directors.

## What I learned in this project?

1. Developed proficiency in creating React app and handling state managment.
2. Gained experience in user authorization and authentication.
3. Realized the importance of efficient API calls and loading indicators for a smoother user experience.
4. Understanding the potential for future improvements to make the app better.
