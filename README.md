## Project

## Project Role: Developer

I was reponsible for creating a React web app that interacts with a the movie API that I made previously to display movie information and user data. The project involved building the UI components, handling user authentication, integrated with the API and implementing search and favorite movies.

6. Add the ability for users to mak movies as favorites.
7. Provided a logout feature to user to log out and clear session.

## What could be done differently?

1. Include adding more information, such as actors and directors views, release date, and ratings.
2. Expanding user profiles with user photos and recommendations for other users.
3. Implementing advanced movie filtering by genre, actors, and directors.

## What I learned in this project?

1. Developed proficiency in creating React app and handling state managment.
2. Gained experience in user authorization and authentication.
3. Realized the importance of efficient API calls and loading indicators for a smoother user experience.
